-The order of steps should tackle similar steps at once to speed up testing for each
-also fixing functionality before creating a GUI

1)Enable single passenger to be picked up and taken to a destination by a single taxi
2)Provide sufficient taxi's to enable multiple independent passengers to be picked up and taken to their destinations concurrently 
3)Enable a single shuttle to pick up one passenger 
4)enable a single shuttle to pick up mulitple passengers
5)ensure taxi's and shuttles can operate concurrently 
6)ensure details of passengers are recorded for whom there are no free vehicles 
7)provide a GUI to display the activities of all active vehicles and passengers
8)Remaining functionality

Tests
1) return true when requestPickup()== true
2) return true if vehicle != NULL
3) similar to 1
4) create multiple passenger objects, assign to same vehicle
5) create multiple passenger and vehicle objects of Taxi and Shuttle,assign pickup at same time
6)return passenger details if vehicle == NULL
7) have multiple objects acting at once and run GUI

act method affects movement by parsing through target locations and working out of its reached the passengers pickup location of destination
also determines if the vehicle has an assignment.

16.20
Yes, it would move from being idle when passenger != Null

16.21
doesnt support multiple taxis as one taxi would act as a shuttle with multiple passengers

16.22
assignments.put(Vehicle, Passenger) doesnt support shuttles having multiple passengers with different locations.
